#  EV Market Segmentation Based on Age (India)

This project focuses on **segmenting the Indian EV market based on the age of the customers**, using demographic and income data from an automobile buying behavior dataset. The goal is to identify which age groups are most likely to adopt Electric Vehicles (EVs) and how their preferences vary in terms of price, salary, and other features.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Age distribution**: Majority of buyers fall in the 26‚Äì38 age range.
- **Loan effect**: Personal and home loans do not strongly influence EV buying.
- **Salary vs Price**: Even high salary groups prefer affordable EVs.
- **Make vs Price**: Some models (like Verna) show wider price range preferences.
- **Dependents vs Price**: No strong correlation observed.
- **Education vs Salary/Price**: Minor difference, not dominant.

**Correlation Heatmap** shows strong correlation between:
- Salary & Total Salary
- Total Salary & Price

## üß™ Data Preprocessing

- **Label Encoding**: Applied to categorical features (`Profession`, `Marrital Status`, etc.)
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardized all numerical features using `StandardScaler`.

---

## üìà Clustering (KMeans)

Used **KMeans** to segment customers based on scaled features.

- **Elbow Method**: Optimal clusters = 3
- **Interpretation of Clusters**:

| Cluster | Age Group   | Income Range     | Preference                     |
|---------|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0       | 45‚Äì51       | Very High         | Premium EVs                    |
| 1       | 20‚Äì30       | Moderate          | Low-to-mid range EVs          |
| 2       | 30‚Äì45       | Average to High   | Wide range, from mid to high  |

- **Visualizations**:
  - `sns.pairplot()` for age, salary, wife salary, total salary, and price.
  - Boxplots and heatmaps for pattern identification.
